# AlphaCen
This repository contains the code I used for the paper "Proxima Centauri's influence on Alpha
Centauri". It's a conglomeration of Mercury files in Fortran, Python to generate Mercury's input
and organize its output as well as do some of the analysis, while R did most of the analysis and 
plotting. Also bash and shell scripts to automate iterations and paste it all together as needed.

It was a long, exploratory process, and a lot of the original intentions as far as organization 
became obsolete and gradually engulfed as the project evolved. Many of the scripts contained 
within have been replaced by later, hopefully cleaner, versions, and summarily abandoned. 

Apologies.
